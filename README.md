# 2023-Herat-Earthquake-Sequence
We provide two datasets about the 2023 Herat earthquake sequence here:


Data_Set_S1: Downsamped co- and post-seismic interferograms. 
Note that the downsampled interferograms are stored in ASCII text format, and each text file contains seven columns representing: “longitude, latitude, LOS-displacement, E-vector, N-vector, U-vector, sacle-factor”

Data_Set_S2: Co- and post-seismic slip distribution models.
Note that the co- and post-seismic slip distribution models were stored in ".simp" format, with each little fault patch recorded as one row, each row containing ten elements, "lon(deg) lat(deg) str(deg) dip(deg) dep(km) wid(km) leng(km) s_slip(m) d_slip(m) o_slip(m) ".
